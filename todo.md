# Untitled Fishing Game

## Scenario
- You play as fish
- There is a local fisherman named Jon H. Unger (Jon for short)
- He comes to the pond every day to fish for food (his family is malnourished and starving)
- You and all your fish friends hate Jon because he is trying to eat you
- You constantly make fun of Jon for his inability to catch fish and for his lack of skills and proper equipment

## Gameplay mechanics
- Once again, you play as fish
- Every time Jon comes your goal is to steal his bait and eat without letting him catch you
- Whether you manage to get the bait and escape will be determined by a quitcktime event
- Getting a perfect quicktime will build up your combo which will earn you more points
- If you fail a quicktime you lose a fish
- From a total of three fish, for every fish you lose, you will lose a star
- The game will last 5 days, at the end you will be given a number of stars and a numerical score based on the number of bait you get and whether you built up a combo multipier

## Upgrades
- During the day you will have time to snatch bait from Jon's hook, getting bait will give you score
- If you did not lose any fish during the day, you are able to select an upgrade during the night
---
### Upgrade types
- Fin upgrade I -> Fish can accelerate faster
- Fin upgrade II -> Fish can deccelerate faster
- Reaction upgrade I -> Quicktime becomes easier
- Reaction upgrade II -> Quicktime sweetspot becomes easier
- Luck upgrade I -> Getting bait can sometimes give you extra points
- Luck upgrade II -> Getting multiple sweetspots in a row increases your chances of getting extra points

## Difficulty
### Daily increase
- Day 1 -> simple quicktime events to harvest points and get used to controling your fish
- Day 2 -> Other two fish come into the foreground, they move around randomly and have a chance to get caught on the hook
  - If they do, you have to do a quicktime to save them which can distract you from your main fish
  - You also lose points
  - To deter them from the hook you have to use your cursor to make them change their direction by clicking near them
- Day 3 -> Friendly fish move faster
- Day 4 -> Friendly fish move even faster, their quicktime events are harder
- Day 5 -> You can no longer quicktime to save friendly fish, you have to make sure they avoid the hook by using your cursor

### Jon's hunger
> With each day that Jon doesn't catch a fish, he becomes more hungry and grows desperate

- Day 1 -> Jon is not that hungry no extras
- Day 2 -> Jon is hungry, he is concentrated and his control over his rod is increased, the hook moves faster and he uses more bait, the quicktimes get more difficult
- Day 3 -> Jon is very hungry, he starts getting frustrated and the hook may move and shake unpredictably at times which can cause it to collide with the main fish or friendly fishies
- Day 4 -> Jon is growing desperate, he has brought grenades that he can throw into the water, if the fish gets caught in the blast, it dies immediately, if it gets caught in a wider radius, it gets stunned temporarily and is unable to move
- Day 5 -> Jon is extremely desperate and will do anything to catch or kill any fish, the number of grenades thrown is increased and he may throw in flashbangs that will temporarily render you unable to see, the hook moves quicker and more unpredictably

If Jon catches a fish throughout the week, his hunger level will go down and he will not increase the difficulty for the next day.
